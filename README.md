## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Frank, a computer science student at Avans Breda in the Netherlands. I've tinkered with various discord/reddit bots in Python, contributed to some mobile apps in Java/Kotlin, worked with C# in .NET and more recently I've been making webapps in JavaScript and TypeScript. I've also been in a love-hate relationship with Lua since I've started coding.

Whether I'm programming or spending my free time playing some games with friends, expect me to be listening to an unhealthy amount of music.

## What I'm working on

Currently I'm mostly using various Js frameworks to make webapps, while in my free time I'm trying to replace my knowledge of Java with an equally trivial knowledge of Kotlin


## Contact me!

If you want to get in touch you can reach me by sending me a quick message on discord, or you could always send me an email, just don't expect me to respond immediately in that case.
