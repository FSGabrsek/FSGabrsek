## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Frank, a computer science student at Avans Breda in the Netherlands. I've tinkered with various discord/reddit bots in Python, contributed to some mobile apps in Java/Kotlin, worked with C# in .NET and more recently I've been making webapps in JavaScript and TypeScript. I've also been in a love-hate relationship with Lua since I've started coding.

Whether I'm programming or spending my free time playing some games with friends, expect me to be listening to an unhealthy amount of music.

## What I'm working on

Currently I'm using Python for some data science assignments, while outside of college projects you can find me trying to learn Svelte
