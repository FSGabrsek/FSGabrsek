## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Frank, a computer science student at Avans Breda in the Netherlands with a minor in Artificial Intelligence. I spend most my time tinkering with backend-related stuff, either with Azure components, .NET, Python or Javascript. I've messed aronund with various forms of web-apps and you can even find me making the occasional Android app if you look hard enough. I've also been in a love-hate relationship with Lua ever since I've started coding. If you ever come across me, you can easiliy identify me as the guy who still carries around pen and paper wherever he goes.

Whether I'm programming or spending my free time playing some games with friends, expect me to be listening to an unhealthy amount of music.

## What I'm working on

Currently I'm either making or connecting various API's, usually using Azure as a platform. Besides that I'm trying to figure out how LLM's work.
